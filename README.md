Currency Converter App

Developed a responsive currency converter application using React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. The app enables users to seamlessly convert Indian Rupees (INR) to US Dollars (USD) and vice versa, leveraging real-time exchange rate data from a Vite API. Key features include:

User-Friendly Interface: Designed a clean and intuitive UI with Tailwind CSS for an enhanced user experience.
Real-Time Data: Integrated API for accurate and up-to-date currency conversion rates.
Responsive Design: Ensured optimal performance and accessibility across various devices and screen sizes.
Efficient State Management: Utilized React hooks for effective state management and improved app performance.
This project showcases my ability to create dynamic web applications and my proficiency in modern web development technologies.
